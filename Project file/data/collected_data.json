    "text": "I'm so angry I don't even know where to start. You know what happened last week? They took Mahadevi. A 40-year-old elephant who lived her entire life in Nandani village in Maharashtra. FORTY YEARS with the same community. The villagers loved her, she was part of their lives, their traditions, their family.\n\nAnd at 12:30 AM on July 28th, under heavy police protection, they dragged her away. The entire village was crying. Crying! Can you imagine losing a family member like that?\n\nWhere did she go? To Mukesh Ambani's son's private zoo in Gujarat. They call it \"Vantara\" - some fancy Sanskrit name that means \"protector of animals.\" What a joke.\n\nThis isn't the first time. I've been following this and the pattern is so obvious it makes me sick:\n\nRemember Pratima from Tripura? Same story. PETA filed a complaint, Supreme Court committee said she needed \"rescue,\" off she went to Vantara.\n\nThen Malti from Rajasthan's Amer Fort. Same exact thing. PETA complaint, court order, straight to Ambani's collection.\n\nNow Mahadevi. Same playbook, same result.\n\nDo you see what's happening here? PETA keeps finding animals in traditional settings - temples, villages, communities where they've lived for decades - and suddenly they're \"suffering\" and need to be \"rescued\" by a billionaire's private zoo.\n\nAnd every single time, the \"rescue\" destination is the same place. What are the odds?\n\nI did some digging and this is what I found:\n\nVantara now has over 150,000 animals from 2000+ species. They've moved more than 100 elephants just from Northeast India alone. They've imported 39,000 animals from 32 different countries. This isn't a rescue center - it's the world's largest private animal collection.\n\nThe Ambanis have spent over 2000 crores on this project. TWO THOUSAND CRORES. And they're calling it charity, getting tax benefits, government awards, the works.\n\nBut here's what really pisses me off - they're planning to open it for tourism. \"Sustainable eco-tourism\" they call it. You know what that means? They used \"rescue\" operations to build a massive zoo, got tax breaks doing it, and now they'll charge people to see all the animals they collected.\n\nIt's brilliant, actually. Evil, but brilliant.\n\nAnd the media? Don't even get me started. Multiple news outlets have deleted their critical articles about Vantara. The Telegraph, Deccan Herald, Financial Express - all removed negative stories or replaced them with promotional content. Some journalists even reported getting threatening emails and offers of money to delete their coverage.\n\nWhen you have Reliance money, you can control the narrative, can't you?\n\nThe worst part is how they're destroying communities. These aren't just animals - they're part of people's lives, culture, traditions. Nandani village had a 1200-year-old tradition with elephants. The Northeast communities have been living with these elephants for generations.\n\nBut apparently, a billionaire's son in Gujarat knows better than entire communities about animal care.\n\nAnd the courts? The Supreme Court committee just rubber-stamps every transfer to Vantara. No questions asked. \"Animal welfare\" they say, as they move elephants from their natural habitat in Northeast to the desert of Gujarat.\n\nThis is how power works in India. You have enough money, you can:\n\n* Get court orders in your favor\n* Control media coverage\n* Silence critics\n* Turn theft into \"rescue\"\n* Build a private empire and call it charity\n\nI'm not saying animals shouldn't be helped when they're actually suffering. But this systematic targeting of community animals, this pattern of always ending up at the same billionaire's facility, this media suppression - it's not animal welfare. It's animal collection.\n\nThey're using our emotions about animal suffering to build a business empire. They're separating animals from communities that have cared for them for decades, even centuries. They're calling it conservation while destroying the actual human-animal relationships that have existed for generations.\n\nAnd we're supposed to applaud because a rich family is \"saving\" animals?\n\nMahadevi didn't need saving from Nandani village. Pratima didn't need saving from her community. These animals needed support IN THEIR HOMES, not displacement to a private zoo thousands of kilometers away.\n\nBut supporting community animal care doesn't build tourism empires, does it?\n\nI don't know what we can do against this kind of money and power. The legal system seems bought, the media is controlled, and they have government support. But at least we can talk about it. At least we can call it what it is.\n\nThis isn't animal rescue. This is systematic exploitation disguised as charity.\n\n\\#BringMahadeviHome #ExposeVantara #ConservationColonialism\n\nShare this if you're as angry as I am. The truth needs to come out.",

    "text": "Elden Ring, the Ardhanarisvara, and Hindu mythology There are thematic links between Elden Ring and Hindu mythology, some of which I believe have previously been overlooked by the lore community.\n\nNotes:\n\n- While I am Indian and I was raised Hindu, most of this is deeper theology than the lay worshipper is generally exposed to. Please don\u2019t mind me quoting Wikipedia at length.\n- I am not trying to say that there is a 1:1 relationship between Hindu deities and the deities of the Lands Between.\n- Some connections I mention might be tangential or nonexistent.\n- When trying to explain the meaning of words, I will be referring to the [Indo-European vocabulary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_vocabulary) Wikipedia article and mentioning Latin cognates.\n- I've linked Wiki articles throughout. Please click through and at least look at the pictures.\n- This was written in dribs and drabs over the last two months or so, please forgive me if it seems disjointed. I'm willing to explain anything here.\n\n### The Ardhanarishvara\n\nThe [Ardhanarishvara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardhanarishvara) (Half-Female Lord) in Hindu religious iconography is the half-male, half-female representation of the union of the god Shiva, god of destruction, with his consort Parvati, goddess of motherhood.\n\n> Ardhanarishvara symbolizes that the male and female principles are inseparable. The composite form conveys the [unity of opposites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_of_opposites) (*coniunctio oppositorum*) in the universe. The male half of Ardhanarishvara stands for [Purusha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purusha) and female half is [Prakriti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prakriti). Purusha is the male principle and passive force of the universe, while Prakriti is the female active force; both are \"constantly drawn to embrace and fuse with each other, though... separated by the intervening axis\". The union of Purusha (Shiva) and Prikriti (Shiva's energy, Shakti) generates the universe, an idea also manifested in the union of the [Linga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linga) of Shiva and [Yoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoni) of Devi creating the cosmos. The Mahabharata lauds this form as the source of creation. Ardhanarishvara also suggests the element of [Kama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kama) or Lust, which leads to creation.\n>\n> Ardhanarishvara signifies \"totality that lies beyond duality\", \"bi-unity of male and female in God\" and \"the bisexuality and therefore the non-duality\" of the Supreme Being. It conveys that God is both Shiva and Parvati, \"both male and female, both father and mother, both aloof and active, both fearsome and gentle, both destructive and constructive\" and unifies all other dichotomies of the universe. While Shiva's rosary in the Ardhanarishvara iconography associates him with asceticism and spirituality, Parvati's mirror associates her to the material illusory world. Ardhanarishvara reconciles and harmonizes the two conflicting ways of life: the spiritual way of the ascetic as represented by Shiva, and the materialistic way of the householder as symbolized by Parvati, who invites the ascetic Shiva into marriage and the wider circle of worldly affairs. The interdependence of Shiva on his power (*Shakti*) as embodied in Parvati is also manifested in this form.\n\nThe parallel between Radagon/Marika and Shiva/Parvati can be drawn here - the union of two supreme deities into a dual being.\n\nRadagon the symbol of Regression is parallel with Shiva, who embodies Purusha, the unchanging, cosmic consciousness. Marika the symbol of Causality is parallel with Parvati, who embodies Prakriti, the essence of matter and energy, the nature of reality.\n\nThe [Samkhya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samkhya) school of Hindu philosophy views reality of being composed of the union of Purusha and Prakriti.\n\n> In S\u0101\u1e43khya puru\u1e63a signifies the observer, the 'witness'. Prak\u1e5bti includes all the cognitive, moral, psychological, emotional, sensorial and physical aspects of reality. It is often mistranslated as 'matter' or 'nature' \u2013 in non-S\u0101\u1e43khyan usage it does mean 'essential nature' \u2013 but that distracts from the heavy S\u0101\u1e43khyan stress on prak\u1e5bti's cognitive, mental, psychological and sensorial activities.\n\nSee also: [Dualism in Indian philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dualism_%28Indian_philosophy%29)\n\n### [Shiva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva)\n\n> Shiva is known as *The Destroyer* within the [Trimurti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimurti), the [Hindu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism) trinity which also includes [Brahma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahma) (the Creator) and [Vishnu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnu) (the Preserver). In the Shaivite tradition, Shiva is the Supreme Lord who creates, protects and transforms the universe.\n>\n> Shiva has many aspects, benevolent as well as fearsome. In benevolent aspects, he is depicted as an [omniscient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omniscience) [Yogi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogi) who lives an [ascetic life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asceticism#Hinduism) on [Mount Kailash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kailash) as well as a householder with his wife [Parvati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parvati) and his two children, [Ganesha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganesha) and [Kartikeya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kartikeya). In his fierce aspects, he is often depicted slaying demons. Shiva is also known as Adiyogi (the first [Yogi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogi)), regarded as the patron god of [yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga), [meditation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation#Hinduism) and the arts. The iconographical attributes of Shiva are the serpent king [Vasuki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasuki) around his neck, the adorning [crescent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crescent) moon, the [holy river](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_river) [Ganga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganga) flowing from his matted hair, the [third eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_eye) on his forehead (the eye that turns everything in front of it into ashes when opened), the [trishula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trishula) or trident as his weapon, and the [damaru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damaru) (drum).\n\n### [Parvati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parvati), Sati, Durga and Kali\n\n> **Parvati**, **Uma** or **Gauri** is the [Hindu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism) goddess of power, energy, nourishment, harmony, love, beauty, devotion, and motherhood. In her complete form, she is a physical representation of [Mahadevi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahadevi) also known as Adi Shakti, the primordial power behind the creation of the universe, the creator and destroyer. She is one of the central deities of the goddess-oriented sect called [Shaktism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaktism), and the supreme goddess in [Shaivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaivism). Along with [Lakshmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshmi) and [Sarasvati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saraswati), she forms the [Tridevi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tridevi).\n>\n> Parvati is a powerful, primordial [mother goddess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_goddess), and also has several fearsome forms and killed evil beings in forms such as Gauri, [Durga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durga), [Kali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali), the ten [Mahavidyas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahavidyas), and the [Navadurgas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navadurga). Parvati is an embodiment of [Shakti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakti). In [Shaivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaivism), she is the recreative energy and power of Shiva, and she is the cause of a bond that connects all beings and a means of their spiritual release. She is also well known as Kamarupa (the embodiment of one's desires) and Kameshvari (the lordess of one's desires).\n\nParvati is a complex goddess and has many different aspects.\n\nShiva's first wife was [Sati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sati_(Hindu_goddess)), who immolated herself in a pyre after her father humiliated and insulted her and her husband. A grief-stricken Shiva left the world behind and became an ascetic in the Himalayas. The historical barbaric practice of [Sati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sati_(practice)) involved widows casting themselves into the funeral pyres of their husbands. I think being aware of this atrocity subconsciously made me disturbed by the concept of Kindling Maidens immolating themselves for their lords, though I did not consciously draw the connection until writing this post.\n\nShe was reborn as Parvati (lit. mountain woman), and joins Shiva in his ascetic meditations on the peak of Mt. Kailash. Shiva attempts to rebuff her but eventually relents and the two are married once more. They go on to have two children, Ganesha and Kartikeya (more on these below).\n\nWhen the demon Mahishasura (lit. buffalo-demon) was threatening the gods, Parvati took the form of the fierce [Durga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durga) to slay him. Durga is a warrior aspect, the righteous fury of the gods unleashed against the wicked.\n\nIn a later time, the demon Raktabija (lit. blood-seed) attacked and could not be killed because he would respawn duplicates from each drop of blood. As the armies of Raktabija clones swelled, Durga summoned forth the aspect of [Kali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali), her darkest rage. Kali devoured the demons and drank every last drop of blood to prevent Raktabija from duplicating again. Kali is depicted as blue-skinned, bearing a garland of beheaded demons, her hands stained red with blood, her mouth bearing fangs and a lolling tongue, accompanied by serpents and jackals.\n\nParvati is the head of a group of mother goddesses called the [Matrikas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrikas). I mention this only because of the similarity in name.\n\n### Blue skin, multiple limbs and Grafting\n\nA common motif in Hindu deific depiction is multiple limbs and/or heads - Durga is depicted as ten-armed, Kartikeya is six-headed, Brahma is three-headed, the demon Ravana is ten-headed, and many more examples. The [Chaturbhuja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaturbhuja), or four arms (*chatur* means 4, cognate to *quattuor*), is a common way to depict deities.\n\nMany gods - Vishnu and his avatars, Kali, sometimes Shiva, are [depicted as blue-skinned](https://smarthistory.org/understanding-divine-blueness-in-south-asia/) as well.\n\nWe see these sorts of depiction with two examples in Elden Ring - the Grafted Lineage and Ranni. Ranni, after burning her original body, is a blue idol with four arms and her [name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rani) is Sanskrit for queen. Change her clothing and she would not be out of place in a Hindu temple. In particular, she seems similar to popular depictions of Kali.\n\nThe sons of Shiva and Parvati are Ganesha and Kartikeya. [Ganesha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganesha), god of beginnings, wisdom, and obstacles, was [decapitated by Shiva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythological_anecdotes_of_Ganesha#Decapitation_by_Shiva) and then had the head of an elephant demon grafted on. [Kartikeya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kartikeya), god of war, was born as six boys whom Parvati combined into one. He is often depicted six-headed and riding a peacock. Grafted Scions, with their peacock wing and mutilated combination of bodies, stand out as a twisted reflection of Kartikeya.\n\n### Maya and the Veil of Marika\n\nThe concept of [Maya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_(religion)) is fundamental to Hindu tradition. Maya means illusion and/or magic, and since the material world is in itself an illusion for immortal souls, there is no difference between illusion and reality.\n\n> Hendrick Vroom explains, \"The term *Maya* has been translated as 'illusion,' but then it does not concern normal illusion. Here 'illusion' does not mean that the world is not real and simply a figment of the human imagination. *Maya* means that the world is not as it seems; the world that one experiences is misleading as far as its true nature is concerned.\" Lynn Foulston states, \"The world is both real and unreal because it exists but is 'not what it appears to be'.\" According to Wendy Doniger, \"to say that the universe is an illusion (m\u0101y\u0101) is not to say that it is unreal; it is to say, instead, that it is not what it seems to be, that it is something constantly being made. M\u0101y\u0101 not only deceives people about the things they think they know; more basically, it limits their knowledge.\"\n>\n> M\u0101y\u0101 pre-exists and co-exists with [Brahman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman) \u2013 the Ultimate Principle, Consciousness. Maya is perceived reality, one that does not reveal the hidden principles, the true reality. Maya is unconscious, Atman is conscious. Maya is the literal, Brahman is the figurative *Up\u0101d\u0101na* \u2013 the principle, the cause. Maya is born, changes, evolves, dies with time, from circumstances, due to invisible principles of nature, state the Upanishads. Atman-Brahman is eternal, unchanging, invisible principle, unaffected absolute and resplendent consciousness. Maya concept in the Upanishads, states Archibald Gough, is \"the indifferent aggregate of all the possibilities of emanatory or derived existences, pre-existing with Brahman\", just like the possibility of a future tree pre-exists in the seed of the tree.\n\nThe power of Marika over illusions, such as drawing a veil over the Shadow lands, could be drawn from the concept of Maya.\n\n### [Brahman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman) and the Greater Will\n\n> In Hinduism, ***Brahman*** ([Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit_language): \u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u0928\u094d; [IAST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration): *Brahman*) connotes the highest universal principle, the [Ultimate Reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_reality) of the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe). In major schools of [Hindu philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_philosophy), it is the non-physical, efficient, formal and final [cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes) of all that exists. It is the pervasive, infinite, eternal truth, consciousness and bliss which does not change, yet is the cause of all changes. *Brahman* as a [metaphysical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics) concept refers to the single binding unity behind diversity in all that exists.\n\n> [Paul Deussen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Deussen) states that the concept of *Brahman* in the Upanishads expands to [metaphysical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics), [ontological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology) and [soteriological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soteriology) themes, such as it being the \"primordial reality that creates, maintains and withdraws within it the universe\", the \"principle of the world\", the \"[absolute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_(philosophy))\", the \"general, universal\", the \"cosmic principle\", the \"ultimate that is the cause of everything including all gods\", the \"divine being, Lord, distinct God, or God within oneself\", the \"knowledge\", the \"Self, sense of self of each human being that is fearless, luminuous, exalted and blissful\", the \"essence of liberation, of spiritual freedom\", the \"universe within each living being and the universe outside\", the \"essence and everything innate in all that exists inside, outside and everywhere\".\n\n> > This whole universe is *Brahman*. In tranquility, let one worship It, as *Tajjalan* (that from which he came forth, as that into which he will be dissolved, as that in which he breathes).\n> >\n> > \u2014 Chandogya Upanishad 3.14.1\n>\n> > Man is a creature of his *Kratumaya* (\u0915\u094d\u0930\u0924\u0941\u092e\u092f\u0903, will, purpose). Let him therefore have for himself this will, this purpose: The intelligent, whose body is imbued with life-principle, whose form is light, whose thoughts are driven by truth, whose self is like space (invisible but ever present), from whom all works, all desires, all sensory feelings encompassing this whole world, the silent, the unconcerned, this is me, my Self, my Soul within my heart.\n> >\n> > \u2014 Chandogya Upanishad 3.14.1 \u2013 3.14.3\n>\n> > This is my Soul in the innermost heart, greater than the earth, greater than the aerial space, greater than these worlds. This Soul, this Self of mine is that Brahman.\n> >\n> > \u2014 Chandogya Upanishad 3.14.3 \u2013 3.14.4\n\nThe Greater Will, depicted as being supreme over the gods and demigods, is analogous to Brahman in this comparison.\n\nAll are one in the Brahman, and it is being separated from the will that is the ultimate cause of the material world and suffering. The ultimate goal of reincarnation is to become one with Brahman again. This brings to mind the Frenzied Flame and its goal of eradication of all division and individuality.",

    "text": "What am I and how do I embrace my relationship with God Sensitive subject matter warning: Childhood sexual abuse, attempt on my own life, religious abuse, eating disorder, and an overall lack of ubderstanding if I am disrespecting a religion that I so love.\n\nThis post will be a recounting of all the struggles that I am having in my life, some related to my relationship with Hinduism, and an appeal for help and guidance on what to do. \n\nI would like to preface further that I am currently seeing a therapist, am setting up a psychatrist, and will be starting Intensive Out Patient care (IOP) for my mental health this week. This post will also serve as way to hopefully progress my healing process \n\nI don't know what I am or even who I am really anymore. I can say that I am survivor of childhood sexual, emotional, psychological, and physical abuse; but, those are not what define me and my story. I want to say I am a man but I hold conflicting beliefs on what that even means, I just know that I don't like being one because it means I am like my father in some way (my primary abuser). But then again, I have many postive male role models in my life that are the exact opposite  and who I wish to be like. I could say I am hindu; however, I do not even truly know what it means to be one.\n\nThe day after I attempted to take my own life, I saw a dark skinned woman with necklace of skulls and multiple arms holding weapons, heads, and bloody objects while I was meditating on the formerly repressed memories of my sexual abuse. I was in the body of my 10 year old self and was still crying and in terror because of my father and had not even noticed he and the woman with him were gone and I wasn't in the chair that forced to stay in while it was happening. I didn't notice that I was on the bank of a river, before this dark woman, until I was seeing through her eyes at my 10 year old self. Then I was before her, and all i could feel was a sense of calm and relife that my pain was over and I immediately walked up to her in tears and embraced her as if she were my mother. I felt truly safe in her embrace, like I was in the arms of my mother when I was a baby. I cried and cried and cried while she petted my head. Then I abruptly fell out of meditative focus and was silently crying without noticing. \n\nI did not know it at the time; but, the figure that I saw in meditation was Mahadevi Maa Kali. The Goddess of Death and Time (among many other things). It was this experiance that I cite as the true start of my journey with Sanata Dharma / Hinduism. Before, almost 5 years to the day, I had sudden burst of emotions and feeling of overwhelming lightness and fullness when I attended a school field trip to a Hindu temple primarily dedicated to the great preserver Vishnu. I ignored those feelings until I saw Maa Kali. \n\nSo I began researching Hinduism extensively. I learned how to properly tie knots for the first time in my life after 23 years of struggling with not being able to in order to make Malas. I used the Amethyst beads I had been carrying with me during my attempt and when I was mediating when I saw Kali (I was lookimg into crystal healing and western style meditation at the time), and took them to location of my abuse and turned them into a Mala. I began chanting mantras to Ganesh after I saw a large white elephant's head with its brain exposed in my dreams. But somwhere along the line I stopped. I learned that I could be harming myself if I spoke mantras incorrectly, at the wrong time, and if I ever spoke the wrong ones. I became terrifed of insulting God in all of its forms, the God that I had come to and still do love with all of my heart. The God that I believe to be in all of us, in all life. The God that loves all and that taught me to have love in my heart, even for my abusers, because everyone has a piece of the God that I love in themselves. I can't even get through a 108 round of Om without bursting into tears. \n\nThe past few months I have been at a loss for how to progress my connection to god. I have tried and failed to attend service at the temple I previously mentioned, I felt like I did not fit in or deserve to be in such a holy place.  I have even explored the Chakras and astrology on their surface level. Yet I have not been able to connect with any form of God to the same depth as meditating silently while thinking of Maa Kali, Lord Shiva, or Lord Ganapati holding me like a child. The only thing that has gotten me even close to feeling that connection was contenplating on what Hindu name I might one day adopt. At least it was postive until I remebered the genuine fear of possibly insulting God by not doing it correctly.\n\nSo here I am. Where here is and whoever is me. I have no idea what to do to progress on my Hinduism journey. I am taking a class on the religions of Inda this upcoming semester, and so far reading the text book has not helped me much. What do I do? Where do I go from here? I want to feel close to God again instead of stewing in my suffering by binge eating every night and lamenting that my Grandmother pushed me out of christanity as young child with her constant persecution of my dead uncle on the grounds of him being gay. \n\nTldr;\nI am a damaged individual who is seeking help with connecting to God in all of its forms through Hinduism. Please help. \n\nNamaste if you have read this far. \n",

The senthan amudhan twist in book didn't sink well with me. The intelligent queen sembian mahadevi was adviced by the super intelligent prime minister Anirudha bharahmarayar to swap the babies but it makes no sense as it is the same Anirudhar who lied to Sundara Chola about Mandakini as he didn't want an unknown woman as the queen, as he feels the child may not be king worthy. So I refuse to accept he would be fine with a random child being made a prince and a possible future king.\n\nKalki may have introduced the twist to remove blemishes on Uttama Chola, as he had showed Madurantakan as a coward earlier(he came in a palanquin), he didn't want people to think Uttama Chola was a coward, so he introduced the Senthan Amuthan character arc, but Mani dealt it better, Madurantakan in film was braver and more intelligent than the book Maduranthakan, so he maybe a good king kinda thing.\n\nThe movie itself was phenomenal, the BGM, cinematography and performances are oscar worthy. The soodanathu ratham reprise was a surprise and I can't wait to hear it again.\n\nMani has really done the best possible condensing the 5 part novel into epic 2 part movie. I too felt he could have avoided war scenes and focused more on drama, since he is so good at drama and not so good at war scenes.\n\nAditha Karikalan - Nandini meeting scene is one of the greatest scene in history of cinema!!  \nThe writing, cinematography( dark lighting with the faces illuminated by lightning flashes was brilliant), music, performances were at their best. Its been a whole day I have not yet come out of the scene, the entire theatre was silent. This shows what Mani is capable of when he is in the zone. I am going watch the movie again, just to see this epic scene.\n\nThe interval scene was brilliant and carries the essence of the novel with the similar scene. Vandiyathevan and Azhwarkadiyan begging Arulmozhi to not mount the elephant and Arulmozhi causally doing his elephant whisper to kill the mahout was just brilliant writing my Mani.\n\nI would have preferred a Kamal outro instead of a text saying about Raja Raja Chola. I also think it would have been amazing if they had shown the crowning of Arulmozhi 14 years later and then played veera raja veera song, it was an amazing song for Raja Raja Chola and it didn't suit Karikalan.\n\nIlayoor Soodar is a purananooru text lamenting about the death of a warrior, no idea why it was played for Mandakini death, either way it worked really well.\n\n**TLDR, the movie is awesome, much better than PS1, BUT GO WITH AN OPEN MIND, AND EXPECT MAJOR DEVIATIONS FROM THE NOVEL.**",

    "text": "Kali lore: Found this weird demonic left hand magic book- name meanings  [Saraswati - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saraswati)  well maybe she really is the key to extinguishing the flame?\n\n [Radha - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radha)  interesting they're both named after goddesses and like her counterpart she is Raj's chief consort aka Krishna who marries other females. So that mean Amala will be submissive to them? After all Amala hasn't been spending as much time with Devi.  \n\nAmala isn't mentioned but is the other name for  [Lakshmi - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshmi)  \\- Kamala. It seems they are reincarnations of each other Radha and Amala?? But It is Sara, Devi, and Amala that form the trio. Supreme divinity with Sara as creator which is interesting, Amala as preserving- she is preserving the Doobay family tree  and Devi the destroyer- she will be destroying something. \n\nOops wrong story for Amala-  [Amrita - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amrita)  Amrita serves the same function- she keeps the Doobay family from going out- drink of immortality or more knowledge and power or Holy water baptism. thing is not everyone is after her. \n\n [Sita - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sita)  This one is the one Ram marries in the OG lore but what is interesting is that it mentions 4 marriages between 4 sons and daughters. I wonder if we will even meet Ian's parents. This may mean Erit may die and Sara marries a kid instead? Or can a kid be married to the kid born to Radha? Omg it is a Thukur! and its faded out but it does look like the Ya at the end of Aditya- the younger heir. What happened to his family afterwards? Ofc this can also mean Sara dying too or running away. \n\n [Mahadevi - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahadevi)  Devi here is too OP- she is the supreme goddess lol. everyone else is just made in her image- avatars or something. without her, they cannot function. \n\n[Radha never marries Raj/Krishna is this version](https://theartarium.com/blogs/news/why-radha-krishna-never-got-married-to-each-other#:~:text=Radha%20Krishna%20Never%20Felt%20Tying,their%20love%20to%20the%20world) yet another version says they married in secret\n\n [Vidya (philosophy) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidya_(philosophy))  Interesting that Vidya is knowledge with agni Vidya- being the science of fire. reminds me of ATLA fire nation agni Kais. She must have discovered something- she did keep her life from being burned alive. Also unlikely that Anil (god of wind/air- minor one) dies or else Radha may go through Sati /White widow trouble. Man she really can't end up with Raj at all. \n\nI also just noticed that there is a Prasad in the Doobay family tree meaning Mohan must've married another wife or its another relative. Its strangely named Aisha again also the name of Devi's nanny so maybe???\n\nKamal means PERFECTION, lotus, divine and interestingly Doran is Irish? meaning exile, warrior, stranger. Doesn't look like he'll fit in with the Dozen. Basically the Indian counter to Ian! not sure how it'll work. \n\n [Mohan, Uttar Pradesh - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohan,_Uttar_Pradesh)  checks out. It just gives the story of where Ram is separated from his wife to Mohan.\n\nArhat is very interesting- He  \"in Buddhism, **a perfected person, one who has gained insight into the true nature of existence and has achieved** **nirvana** **(spiritual enlightenment)**. The arhat, having freed himself from the bonds of desire, will not be reborn. \"  But he achieves it through the teachings of another. that is the difference between him and Buddha. Buddhism did come from india too although more associated it with China. China is mentioned by Mohan...which he when the Boxer rebellion happened and they were massacred sooo things are getting chaotic. \n\n [Manush: Child of Destiny - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manush:_Child_of_Destiny)  Hold the fuck on! What if the traitor is Rati's Dad who stayed behind?? THAT sleeper agent. He has paper/printing press. Maybe he made a mistake in getting his daughter killed and now with nothing holding him back, he wants to ruin Vidya's plans, etc? maybe thinking it too much of a tiger's name but its a movie where one's enemy can become a friend. If the Dozen is meeting again, that means he must show up. There has been no mention of the lower family head. Like what did Vidya do for them afterwards? Oh Gosh.  do they know something? \n\nBut yeah those are all the names.  But there is an elephant on the table and that is  [Ganesha - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganesha)  THE REMOVER OF OBSTACLES!!! WHO THE FUCK IS IT??? god of new beginnings, its a man with an elephant head.  He can also place obstacles- It has to be the banerjees/Rati right? They're the only other family introduced with very few lines that is related to the pliot.  \n\n[left hand path](https://preview.redd.it/0toynvbc5usc1.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b55c4672ebc8d48ffe85aa81a5d212ccd44f02d)\n\n[Saraswati = Sarasvati - I never thought to think their names may be clues!!!

    "text": "What happened during the Void Century ? Hi nakamas! Irecently readed the earlier chapter, and with what we know today, I readed them differently and came up with some ideas. As a first theory and not being English native, feel free to tell me if some part is confusing!  \n\nTL;DR: Jaya is where the AK used to be. The Flower Capital of future Wano was the left eye and moved using Uranus (created the caves and Knock-Up Stream later). Joy Boy and Imu was in the AK with another guy. Imu and 5 elders betrayed the AK.  \n\n**The links between the Void Century and the Hinduism**\n\n*Please note I consider this as one source of inspiration for Oda, so of course One Piece will not mirror EVERY point, else it wouldn\u2019t be hard to guess the future events. Even the mythology can have two opposite versions about the same myth.*\n\n**Vishnu, Brahma, and Shiva**\n\nThey represents the Trimurti and can have different meanings. I will focus on these which Oda could have be inspired from. I will detail below why I think Joy Boy, Nika, Luffy, and others are inspired from Vishnu while Xebec, BlackBeard and others from Brahma, and Imu from Shiva. On a side note, gender is not important here, the Trimurti can be male or female.\n\nThere is a story which happens between the 6th and 7th century CE (around same century as the Void Century in OP). Vishnu (Joy Boy) and Brahma (a Xebec/BB personality who lives same period as Joy Boy) were great rivals (Roger/Xebec, Luffy/BB). One day, they heard a voice and saw a huge pillar. The voice said, the first who find the end of the pillar will be the greatest. Vishnu chooses to go for the bottom and went underground (FMI reference). Brahma went towards the top (The thirst of power/superiority Xebec and BB are looking for). Vishnu came back, he couldn\u2019t find the end. Brahma came back too, he didn\u2019t find the end neither but lie about it because he prioritize power over honesty. Shiva (Imu) was the one who made this pillar and he knew Brahma was lying. He cursed Brahma that he will never be worshiped again.\n\nBrahma is today the least worshiped of these 3 gods. (Xebec erased from history while Roger still is an important figure, and Imu well, she basically rules the world).\n\n**The link between Vishnu and the Joy Boy-like characters**\n\nHe\u2019s known as the \u201cPreserver\u201d. Joyoboyo is directly linked to him. When the world is threatened by evil and chaos, Vishnu restore the order. He have ten primary avatars (Dashavatara). Rama and Krishna are the most important aside from the first one: Matsya, and the last one: Kalki (Luffy), the one who ends the darkest period, he removes adharma (evil, immorality, unrighteousness\u2026) from the world. The Sun God can be considered as the Incarnation of Rama (Nika), and Krishna would be from the Moon God (plenty of Moon\u2019s reference in OP). Let\u2019s focus on the 1st avatar: Matsya. He looks like a fishman. (Joy Boy related to FMI). Now about the legend of Matsya. He saved Manu from the Deluge. Manu once protected Matsya until he was big enough. The gods gives a ship to Manu (Noah, the ship made by gods). When the great flood begins, they are going towards the mountains (RedLine).\n\nMost people of the D. Clan can be linked to him (except Xebec/BB).\n\n**The link between Brahma and the Xebec-like characters**\n\nWe already saw he thrives for power and don\u2019t care about the means as long as his goal is completed (Very Xebec/BB-like), and that he often argues with Vishnu. He\u2019s commonly described having multiple heads and arms, 3 or 4 most of the time. BB is the only one who\u2019s using multiple DF. [And look how his Jolly Roger got 3 skulls](https://imgur.com/a/vjv38dL) The fact that he never sleeps could be related but maybe the only reason is he\u2019s from the snow country. Brahma is known for having great knowledge (DF\u2019s knowledge). Overall, we don\u2019t know much about Xebec and BB so it\u2019s hard to find as much common points as for the others. Only Xebec and BB are known characters which could be linked to Brahma\u2019s way of acting/thinking.\n\n**The link between Shiva and Imu**\n\nShe\u2019s known as \u201cthe Great God\u201d or \u201cthe Supreme God\u201d (Imu\u2019s ruling the world). Within the Trimurti, she can be called \u201cthe Destroyer\u201d (destroying Ancient Kingdom). She\u2019s often associated with the crescent moon (the moon being heavily related to AK and AK\u2019s allies, and I think Imu is from the AK). She can be seen as \u201cthe one who can kill the forces of darkness\u201d (it\u2019s the case from WG\u2019s PoV). She\u2019s a god of \u201cambiguity and paradox\u201d, depicted as \"the standard of invincibility, might, and terror\". And after the Void Century. Five is a sacred number for Shiva (5 elders, the WG emblem). One aspect of Shiva is represented by Gajasurasamhara (the Slayer of the elephant demon) or Matangari (the Enemy of the elephant), that could be related to Zunesha as we will see in the theory part. Shiva\u2019s often represented with 5 faces (5 elders).\n\nIn the present and most likely since the Void Century\u2019s events, beating Joy Boy and maybe the ancient BB (I\u2019ll call this unknown like this from now), I consider Imu is putting herself as Mahadevi, the \u201cDivine Mother\u201d, the \u201cSupreme Energy who possess all riches, all strength, all knowledge\u2026\u201d. This fits Imu very well since she\u2019s probably the only one who knows everything (other nobles probably knows more than usual people but they didn\u2019t live during the Void Century themselves), she decides the fate of everything, she have all the WG\u2019s firepower under her orders. She controls [the Navagrahas, which look much like the Kozuki crest, or Alabasta flag, and other AK\u2019s related symbol](https://imgur.com/a/JYsDsvj). This one is very interesting: she rules the Earth and controls the Navagrahas which are: Suryan (the Sun), Chandran (the Moon), Chevvai (Mars), Rahu (Ascending node of the Moon), Shani (Saturn), Kethu (Descending node of the Moon), Guru (Jupiter), Budhan (Mercury), and Shukran (Venus). Alright so she rules the Earth and controls 5 others planets.\n\nSo she basically controls 6 planets including the Earth but there are still 3 missing right? Which are Pluton, Uranus, and Neptune (Roman\u2019s Poseidon). That\u2019s exactly the three ancient weapons, also known as the greatest threats for the WG with the D and the Poneglyphs. Let\u2019s look at her name now: Imu or \u30a4\u30e0. Eve is \u30a4\u30d6 (Ibu) in Japanese while Adam is \u30a2\u30c0\u30e0 (Adamu). So Imu is like the first letter of Eve combined with the last of Adam, like she\u2019s Adam and Eve at the same time, the complete origin of the World. The first letter being from Eve, it reinforces my thought about Imu being a female character. And the Sunlight Tree Eve\u2019s roots being in FMI, this tree is potentially in Mary Geoise too.\n\nAlright, that was a lot of parallels but if I want to theorize from something, it\u2019s needed!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What could have happened during the Void Century?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Let\u2019s see what happened** ***before*** **the Void Century (which could be relevant about it)**\n\n***Current Year is around 1.525 in the Kaienreki Calendar***\n\nAround 3.500 years before the Kaienreki Calendar, [the Seed of Knowledge is planted on Ohara](https://imgur.com/a/YqbvJfp).\n\n[The Alabasta Kingdom is founded](https://imgur.com/a/7wNw28M) around 2.500 years before the Kaienreki Calendar.\n\nBefore 402, and due to a lack of resources, three (at least) Moon\u2019s races moves to the Earth. However these 3 separates in 3 different places.\n\nIn 402, [Shandora, the City of Gold prosperous](https://imgur.com/a/FrTaziJ).\n\nAround 525, [Minks starts living on Zou](https://imgur.com/a/9o2PNGt), I\u2019d find it more logical if it were during the Void Century, still possible since Law said \u201caround 1.000 years\u201d.\n\n**What do we** **know** **happened** ***during*** **the Void Century?**\n\nWell, not much obviously, the Ancient Kingdom was defeated by a 20 kingdom\u2019s alliance, Imu being a part of this alliance, either betraying the AK, or as a member of the 20 WG. Joy Boy promised to FMI he would raise Noah with Poseidon\u2019s aid but he had to break his promise. FMI still maintained it by protecting Noah at all cost, waiting for the promise being fulfilled centuries later. [Joy Boy apologized in a letter](https://imgur.com/a/EjYDcBZ). He managed to [let a treasure on Laugh Tale](https://imgur.com/a/pqyzKwf). [The City of Shandora is destroyed](https://imgur.com/a/FrTaziJ).\n\n**What happened** ***after*** **the Void Century?**\n\n[The WG is created. Unlike the 19 others, the Nefertari family refused to live in Mary Geoise](https://imgur.com/a/zBv37Z7). All history of this century is buried.\n\nWano closes its border and the Kozuki family creates the Poneglyphs, to preserve the events of the Void Century, to lead worthy people to Joy Boy\u2019s treasure and informing about the Ancient Weapons. Somehow the Poneglyphs are indestructible, except for those who created them: they had to engrave the message at least, and maybe even shape their forms. It\u2019s most likely they didn\u2019t tell even their own heirs to be sure the WG never find out. Poneglyphs are brought to multiple locations, most likely to Ancient Kingdom\u2019s allies (Shandora, Alabasta, Zou, FMI, Ohara\u2026).\n\nThe WG eventually discovered about it and immediately prohibited any research on it.\n\nAround 1 487, Roger and Garp fought Xebec\u2019s crew including Kaido, Big Mom, WB. It will be called the [God Valley Incident](https://imgur.com/a/D1QIqnb) and the island will mysteriously disappeared. The fact that [Nobles were here with slaves](https://imgur.com/a/vKeoiiA), and that the WG not only [erased it from the map but made the island disappear](https://imgur.com/a/tsc4G95) too shows this island was very important.\n\n**Alright let\u2019s start the theory part**\n\n**God Valley**: I think Roger and Garp had to go against their principles about CD because of the threat Xebec represented, he wanted to bring down the WG, but he would have rule in an even worse way. He probably discovered some important WG\u2019s secret on this island. It could be about devil fruits: Kaido and WB having 2 of the best fruits is maybe not a coincidence. The Nobles being here too, maybe Vegapunk is making experiments here and [Nobles like to use slaves as guinea pig about DF](https://imgur.com/a/EaFbTZN).\n\nAbout BB: he has a lot of knowledge about DF: [he could easily identify the Yami Yami and wanted this fruit](https://imgur.com/a/locdrQ2), he called his ship \u201cthe Saber of Xebec\u201d. Maybe the Yami was Xebec\u2019s DF and/or is needed to have multiple DF and this was noted in a journal by Xebec who could be BB\u2019s dad, and he would be using his mother\u2019s name like Ace. Or maybe BB is just Xebec\u2019s Bartolomeo!\n\n\nI think that\u2019s likely the case because [Imu\u2019s cutting his bounty with Luffy\u2019s and Shirahoshi\u2019s pic](https://imgur.com/a/9ghuW0P) too, before [keeping Vivi\u2019s pic on her way to the throne](https://imgur.com/a/GmCmbH5). I see it like she\u2019s seeing Luffy is linked to Joy Boy, BB to the ancient BB characters, Vivi to Pluton and Shirahoshi to Poseidon (even being it). She\u2019s probably thinking about a plan to kill Luffy/BB but since they are quite strong, it\u2019s not that easy. About the 2 girls tho, she could easily kill them so I think she wants to use them in order to be truly invincible. About Uranus, I think it\u2019s related to Wano and Momo/Hiyori could be the key. Hiyori would be better, Momo saving the citizens and becoming Shogun is enough, and the ancient weapons would be linked to a blue haired, a pink haired, and a green haired lady. Luffy\u2019s often wearing red clothes (+his hat has red in it). POWER RANGERS LET\u2019S GO. Sorry about that. I\u2019d prefer that in Pluton and Uranus\u2019 cases, the characters linked to it will not be both the weapon like for Poseidon (i.e. a Nefertari only needed to unlock the access to Pluton would be fine). About Uranus, maybe a Kozuki is the key, maybe Imu is, or maybe both are! Let me explain an unlikely thought below.\n\n**What could Uranus be?**\n\nAm I saying there are possibly 2 Uranus? No.\n\nBut I think Imu, and someone else (in Luffy\u2019s side), has access to it.\n\nPluton is the strongest battleship, Poseidon has the ability to command sea monsters and raise Noah. I think Uranus may be linked to the ability to move islands.\n\nYeah I know a legend says [Oars could do it](https://imgur.com/a/5csixeE) without being an ancient weapon. But do you really see someone around the same height as some Numbers, moving islands (while swimming)? I mean Numbers are failures, Oars is stronger than one, but you could technically with multiple Numbers at least equal his strength, and even all numbers working together, I don\u2019t see them able to move a whole island at all. I think Oars\u2019 legend is born from Uranus, which would be something (or someone) much bigger than Oars.\n\nZunesha is around 10.000 times bigger than an elephant. Well Uranus wouldn\u2019t be this much bigger than Oars (would be 670 km, everyone in the world would see it lmao) but you get the idea. Maybe something that would have a head that could fit Onigashima, which would obviously not be Uranus\u2019 skull, else the Ancient Weapon would be destroyed. We could definitely see Onigashima as a reproduction tho, especially when [Marco says this](https://imgur.com/a/dM8X0Uy). This island would be here as a reminder.\n\nAnyway, if the RedLine was created, something we still don\u2019t know has to be used. But if Uranus is the way (something this important is either an Ancient Weapon, or/and the National Treasure), it\u2019d mean it was, at least for a moment in WG\u2019s hands. It would fit the link to the sky: gigantic heights and related to the Moon (Kozuki meaning Moon of Light).\n\nThing is, if Uranus is a living thing, then the characters related to it should be the one able to command it. In this case I\u2019d be afraid Momo could be Uranus (nothing against him, I\u2019m just defending my Power Rangers theory!!) and the power could be to command demonic beasts (which would be only few, unlike Sea Kings, maybe only Zunesh and Uranus), unless all the Kozuki (wouldn\u2019t be surprised for such an important family in the history) could have this power and unlike Poseidon, Uranus\u2019 users wouldn\u2019t be rare amongst generations. That\u2019d explained why Yamato said [it\u2019s **imperative** that he survive because he **must** guide the **world** to the **dawn**](https://imgur.com/a/AT63tPo). That really looks like a big deal, not only for Wano from my point of view. And saying he\u2019s **the one** made me wonder about my Hiyori theory.\n\nI think we will know more about it by the end of Wano, hoping one of the Poneglyph is about Uranus. Now where would be Uranus? Well, I think it\u2019s in Mary Geoise (which btw would fit the sky theme too, by its altitude) but I\u2019ll detail this theory below. Back to the original question!\n\n**What** **could have** **happened** ***during*** **the Void Century?**\n\nLike we saw, Joy Boy finally couldn\u2019t fulfill his promise to FMI.\n\nThe events suggests that he realized it before the definitive defeat: he had the time for writing his apologies, hiding something on Laugh Tale, telling or writing on a paper to the Kozuki about it (since they engraved it on Poneglyphs few years after the Void Century). It means the Ancient Kingdom (at least Joy Boy\u2019s side) were overwhelmed by the enemy.\n\nWe know the alliance between the 20 Kingdoms won. How, with three ancient weapons and higher technologies could you lose to technologically and military inferior kingdoms? Well you don\u2019t.\n\nI believe there was at first a conflict inside the AK. I\u2019ll use an example: Joy Boy, Ancient BB, and Imu had a disagreement (about how to rule the kingdom or who must rule or anything). Maybe even, the ancient BB started this fight, in such a brutal way: he used Pluton, the ruler of the underworld, this would fit this character related to darkness, and the other two had to fight him 2v1 (like Roger and Garp vs Rocks). Was it a 2v1, a 1v1 (if Imu stayed out of it) a 1v1v1, it\u2019s not the real matter. In the end, the ancient BB was stopped. Not without great losses from the two (or three) sides, including the death of the ancient BB itself.\n\nNote that when I say Joy Boy, ancient BB, Imu, I\u2019m talking about side, so that includes everyone who supported them too.\n\n**Now 2 options**:\n\n\\-Seeing the AK destroy itself, the other kingdoms saw an opportunity to take the control. Seeing this, Imu saw the opportunity to get rid of Joy Boy and decided to change her side with the condition of being the one who rule after the war. They accepted because that\u2019d almost guarantee them to win. Imu vs Joy Boy would\u2019ve been a tough fight, but Imu + 20 Kingdoms vs Joy Boy was different.\n\n\\-Imu is the first to have the idea of this alliance. I personally like it more this way, being the one who initiate the war which allow them to rule gives you more credit to be the supreme ruler than the first way.\n\nJoy Boy seeing the defeat were inevitable, thought of the \u201cbest way to lose\u201d, the way which could lead to a future win, even if it\u2019s centuries later.\n\nSince he managed to precisely predict the time this day will come (Roger\u2019s crew learning they are too early on Laugh Tale), I think he could\u2019ve asked the ancient FMI fortune teller, [our nowadays Shyarly](https://imgur.com/a/VEGZIiK).\n\nHe (or allies) managed then to hide Pluton from Imu. Since Pluton is related to Alabasta, and there is a Poneglyph about Poseidon over there, I think he made an alliance with the ancient Nefertari ruler, who will pretend to be in the enemy side in order to do it, and when the job is done, they would refuse to live in Mary Geoise: they loved their citizens unlike other Kingdoms like Dressrosa with [Donquichotte family who enslaved Tontattas since way before the Void Century](https://imgur.com/a/YqEmiNV). I believe most of the 19 Kingdoms\u2019 ruler was this kind of person (they wouldn\u2019t enjoy having slaves otherwise), and they were obviously jealous of the Ancient Kingdom\u2019s greatness, they jumped on the opportunity to be the supreme rulers, even considering themselves as Gods.\n\nSo, Joy Boy side managed to hide Pluton, and Poseidon is an ally of the AK. Poseidon can\u2019t be used by force btw so Imu\u2019s alliance couldn\u2019t use it. At most she could kill her but that\u2019s all. I don\u2019t think she tried to because going underwater wasn\u2019t the best idea in this war.\n\n**Where was Uranus and the Ancient Kingdom?** **What happened next?**\n\nSince [Wano **WAS** once called the Country of Gold](https://imgur.com/a/2c9cgD3), and we don\u2019t see much gold in Wano, I think the heart of today\u2019s Wano and Shandora was once part of the same island: Jaya. And that Jaya was the former Ancient Kingdom.\n\nOne thing is strongly supporting this theory: Jaya, in Hinduism was representing one of the 2 guardians of the God Vishnu\u2019s homeland. The island of Jaya being Joy Boy\u2019s homeland seems very solid. Plus it's the first place where Luffy meets BB. (Vishnu/Brahma vibe)\n\nShandora being the Skull\u2019s right eye, I think The Flower Capital was the left eye. Do you see that [Oars looking giant with an axe next to the missing eye](https://imgur.com/a/D9inOhM)? I think it\u2019s representing Uranus, controlled by a former Kozuki, which used this axe to separate the left eye from the Island. Not able to control his terrific strength, this probably created the giant underwater caves which later generated the earthquakes and lately the Knock-Up Stream. About the other things on the map, I think the bird could be the same as on Kozuki crest, the beak would match. And he's looking where the Flower Capital used to be. The head could be to show the death of ancient BB and the sea monster next to him who seems to die would be Pluton, which ancient BB used in vain.\n\nOnce separated, he took the Flower Capital (probably was another name), put it to today\u2019s place (there wasn\u2019t RedLine to cross at this time). He took 5 other islands next to it and made [the Wano of 6 islands we know today](https://imgur.com/a/KIGtfyZ), he called it \u201cWano Kuni\u201d which means \u201cCountry of Harmony\u201d. No need to remind [how Wano is considered special](https://imgur.com/a/HGl0C5B). About Kaido staying here **BECAUSE** it\u2019s Wano, I think, since he couldn\u2019t be Joy Boy and he know Joy Boy will ultimately come to Wano, he\u2019s waiting for him. We could consider him like the \u201cJoy Boy trial\u201d haha, if you lose you\u2019re not Joy Boy, because Joy Boy is fated to overthrow the WG. If he can\u2019t be Joy Boy, he wants to at least witness Joy Boy\u2019s actions, maybe to understand what makes him different from Joy Boy too.\n\nUranus and its commander took care of putting Wano in a hard/impossible to reach location. It was crucial because the people here will need to accomplish necessary actions in order to have a chance of fulfilling JoyBoy\u2019s promise and restoring peace.\n\nAfter doing this, Joy Boy told to Kozuki family about the Laugh Tale location, his letter of apologies to the mermaid princess, and everything else they didn\u2019t know (Ancient Weapons could be one of these things). Since Kozuki were part of Ancient Kingdom, they already knew some information and they literally lived during the Void Century so no problem about the main part of the history.\n\nOnce done, Joy Boy and a Kozuki who could command Uranus quickly left Wano to avoid Imu\u2019s alliance finding out about it. During this time, Zunesha, the Minks, and potentially other allies (Giants? Fishmen?) were slowing down the alliance. However at one point, Imu joined her allies and was able to punish Zunesha: I don\u2019t see the Minks started to live on Zunesha while he was already walking.\n\nAs we saw, Imu really have common points with the god Shiva. Shiva is known for being the \u201cEnemy of the elephant\u201d, and she have a third eye. I thought Imu has in fact an awakened third eye with the same abilities as the Kozuki (I don\u2019t see her as a Kozuki in case you think about that). She then used her third eye to command the demonic beasts like Zunesha and Uranus.\n\nThen after [condemning Zunesha to endlessly walk](https://imgur.com/a/azXpl5p) and never be able to act by himself again, she finds Joy Boy. She saw he\u2019s with a Kozuki and Uranus. Joy Boy and the Kozuki member are defeated.\n\nImu, not knowing what Joy Boy planned, consider the war is over. She uses her power to command Uranus, go where the Sunlight Tree Eve is and build the RedLine to rule over the world. During this process, she finds out about the Lunarian tribe, [who used to live over the RedLine](https://imgur.com/a/RvoTHgw) and seeing they are strong and could be a future potential threat, defeat them, potentially with Uranus. Only few (King\u2019s ancestors included) of them manages to escape and decides to live hidden.\n\n**From now on, the WG is created**:\n\nImu is the true Supreme ruler of this world.\n\nBelow, there are the 5 Elders: they are acting different from the Celestial Dragons, the word \u201cElder\u201d differentiates them, especially since one seems not that old. I think they are either descendants of Imu\u2019s allies during the Void Century or they even were with her during this time, depends if they managed to find enough Ope-Ope No Mi before dying. [They seems to not age and to know more than the average CD too](https://imgur.com/a/eIyQ2ZY), who only seems to enjoy enslaving people and acting like idiot, considering themselves as Gods. I think Imu and the Elders managed to be the only one even in Mary Geoise to know about the Void Century. The CD could know more things than the rest of the World, but probably not everything. They wouldn't let Doflamingo's parents live with humans if they were able to tell about the Void Century.\n\nThe Nefertari family is the only one to go back to their Kingdom, I consider they did their part of the Joy Boy\u2019s plan and now need to protect Pluton and a Poneglyph related to it.\n\nImu, the elders, and the CD lives in Mary Geoise (could be a reference to Mary Joy: the \u201cNew Eve\u201d being a devotional name for the Mary, and we saw the link between Eve (Ibu) and Imu). Plus the Sunlight Tree Eve is probably there too or at the very least below it since its roots is in FMI.\n\nUranus is there too, potentially as the National Treasure. [The room in which the giant strawhat is](https://imgur.com/a/PCaazAZ), could potentially Uranus\u2019 hat and he is there too. [The cold room reminds us of how Moria used to keep Oars](https://imgur.com/a/b4PMdwV) and should only be needed if there is a living being. Joy Boy did the giant hat like Ace did one for Little Oars Jr. Maybe the hat seems too small for such a weapon but not sure. Even if that\u2019s the case, maybe he just kept it in his back like Luffy often does. Imu ordered Uranus to stay here without moving until she says otherwise (the complete opposite of Zunesha). Maybe she did use it in order to move God Valley after the Incident tho.\n\nThe [Pangaea Castle](https://imgur.com/a/1aBdbaE) is an obvious reference which confirms they linked different lands to make the RedLine.\n\nThe Ancient Kingdom (Jaya without the Flower Capital) is destroyed with almost everyone being killed. All the knowledge and civilization is now ashes. Survivors of Jaya who were once technologically ahead the others kingdoms are now behind. That\u2019s [confirmed during the Noland\u2019s visit](https://imgur.com/a/5o6Fwr8) and when you look at the actual state of the island too.\n\nThe Ancient Kingdom\u2019s knowledge is now preserved in Wano by the Kozuki, and potentially other Wano families since Wano is not only [the home of the Poneglyph\u2019s creator](https://imgur.com/a/KJKFFxS), this country is known for creating the best weapons, [mastering sea stone use](https://imgur.com/a/NTqOZDv), and different kind of technological prowess.\n\n**Why Luffy would success where Joy Boy failed?**\n\nWell like Joy Boy, he\u2019s allied with Poseidon. Imu would still have Uranus, and I can really see BB finding Pluton despite Luffy being friend with Alabasta (like Joy Boy probably was). Imu will have the Marines which didn\u2019t exist back then.\n\nThe most difference will be that this time, the Kingdoms will be Luffy\u2019s allies and like Mihawk said, [his best ability is the one he has to make allies](https://imgur.com/a/BYZG7BZ). With them, Luffy will beat Imu and put an end to slavery, discrimination, unrighteousness\u2026\n\nWe must not forget the Revolutionaries too, which didn\u2019t exist back then, and was created because of Imu\u2019s alliance way of ruling. Plus I can see some Marines helping Luffy during the final battle, with the WG showing its true face. Smoker, Garp, maybe Fujitora, Sengoku, Kobby and others could help Luffy. If Imu did change side during the Void Century, it\u2019s now Imu\u2019s allies who will change side. I could even see Kaido and Big Mom (or part of their crew) helping Luffy in the end.\n\nIn the end, RedLine will be destroyed by Uranus (the one who built it will in the end destroy it), leading to the All Blue like it was before the Void Century, the fishmens will live on the earth because the RedLine destruction will fall on the FMI and destroy it. The destruction of their land will be the symbol of their freedom and Joy Boy\u2019s promise will finally be fulfilled, not only by Luffy, but by all his crew and allies.\n\nAlright so that was about my main thoughts of the Void Century. Now I wanted to look about the demon side I sometimes mentioned.\n\n**Demons in One Piece**\n\nI mentioned the demonic beasts Zunesha and Uranus. We saw with [Cavendish and his demon Hakuba](https://imgur.com/a/VKRwaW2) that demons are not a myth in OP\u2019s world. I think when someone has an inside demon, the demon is manifested by the eyes. Look at Cavendish\u2019s eyes when he\u2019s Hakuba (demon who rides a white horse like him in Japan btw).\n\n\nWell now we have the [same eyes for Zunesha](https://imgur.com/a/DXsgiFU), which I called then a demonic beast, I consider Uranus will have the same eyes.\n\nOn the human side, [Imu has the same too](https://imgur.com/a/xl5C277), I consider then she\u2019s related demon too and maybe having a third eye + an inner demon is a condition to awaken her power. She\u2019d probably be the only third eyed able to do so then. Maybe the third eye myth comes from people hearing a third eyed person can do godlike thing but this is a false myth and only Imu is capable of it (Like the Oars/Uranus comparison).\n\nNow let\u2019s talk about Mihawk! Yeah [this badass got demonic eyes too](https://imgur.com/a/KtvBDmP) and I think it totally fits him: Dracule being related to a demon isn\u2019t shocking. I think, unlike Cavendish, he managed to surpass his demon.  If you\u2019re strong enough, no demon can take control of your body.\n\nLast but not least, Zoro: between his Ashura (literally \u201cdemon\u201d) and the fact his opponents often feels a threat from him, and not only because he seems to be a strong swordsman. I think he\u2019s related to a demon too. Did he seal it in his left eye? Will he use it during his last battle? Maybe he asked Mihawk (who is in the same situation and probably knows well about it) to seal it because he only wants to use it against him. This is not needed to have a demonic strength against opponents who haven\u2019t.\n\nWell look about all the humans related to demons and the fact the strongest can control their demon. Yeah they are all swords user! Maybe some sword are hosting a demon and if you can't control it, he can kills you or allies, people then said some blades are cursed. What if the Wado Ichimonji demon (Asura\u2019s? Unless it\u2019s Sandai Kitestu\u2019s) is the reason of Kuina\u2019s death? Maybe it\u2019s just bad luck yeah.\nl\nTalking about demons, [Sulong form looks like one](https://imgur.com/a/WxQfE7k), doesn\u2019t it?! Yeah we will know talk about the moon in OP\u2019s world.\n\n**The Moon in One Piece**\n\nThe Moon is very important. Many families, races, stories are based on it. It\u2019s even the title of 2 chapter.\n\nChapter 28 \u201cWaxing Crescent\u201d takes place before the fight against Kuro who [used the Moon for his 3 year plan](https://imgur.com/a/GvQdbya) (could Luffy\u2019s journey lasts 3 years? TS+1 year). [When he\u2019s seeing the Moon, he\u2019s entering in a murderous frenzy](https://imgur.com/a/MT6gpOJ). And if you look at a waxing crescent and join the 2 ends, [it really look like a \u201cD\u201d](https://imgur.com/a/YpMRiFH).\n\nChapter 152 \u201cFull Moon\u201d is interesting because it\u2019s the chapter Chopper is joining the crew. An animal joining the crew and the chapter\u2019s title being \u201cFull Moon\u201d. Remind me what happens when an animal tribe like the Minks are looking at a full Moon?\n\nLet\u2019s look at the Moon races: we already know about the Shandians, the Skypieans, and the Birkans. We saw earlier they went to Earth around before year 402 (the year of Shandora\u2019s golden age). The Skypieans and the Birkans always lived in in the sky when Shandorians lived on Jaya, aka the Ancient Kingdom in this theory. I think all Jaya civilians were from the Moon if we consider it the Ancient Kingdom, known to be more technologically advanced than the people who always lived on the Earth. Did Joy Boy, Imu and other have wings too? We don\u2019t know, but that\u2019s not mandatory at all. Maybe Shandorians are called like that because on Jaya were living other Moon races like JoyBoy\u2019s and Wano\u2019s family. They both could be humans who used to live on the Moon and therefore are technologically advanced (Ancient Weapons, Poneglyphs, architecture\u2026). You can see that in Wano, 5 out of the 6 main families have \u201cMoon\u201d in their name:\n\n\\-**Kozuki**: Moon of Light. The main Wano family. Their destiny could be to enlighten the world with ancient knowledge. They have a strong bond with the Mink Tribe.\n\n\\-**Shimotsuki**: Frost Moon. The family of Ryuma, Wano\u2019s legendary samurai. But also founded the Shimotsuki Village. Many of their members are linked to Zoro: Kozaburo, Koushirou and Kuina from his village and the first one forged one of his current blade. He fought Ryuma and got Shusui from this fight. Ushimaru looks like him.\n\n\\-**Amatsuki**: Heaven Moon. This family used to live outside of Wano around the end of the Void Century. Were they helping to bring the Poneglyphs to the right places? All we know is that Toki was born outside of Wano and she wanted to get back there, probably because she knew she will be needed here. She married Oden and got 2 kids with him: Momonosuke and Hiyori.\n\n\\-**Utsuki**: Rain Moon. We don\u2019t know if there is any survivor of this family.\n\n\\-**Fugetsu**: Wind Moon. Same as the Utsuki family.\n\nLet\u2019s note that **Tenguyama Hitetsu**, a great swordsmith, descendant of the legendary Kotetsu, lives in Wano too. The fact he has wings probably links him to a Moon race. The closest we know would be Birkans but we can\u2019t be sure until confirmed, his wings seems a bit longer like Urouge.\n\nThe **Kurozumi** (\u201cBlack charcoal\u201d) family is the 6th family of Wano. They were once of the 6 ruling families when Wano was truly the Land of Harmony. However they always tried to take Kozuki\u2019s family place and finally managed it while Oden was with Roger\u2019s crew. Kurozumi Orochi is the current shogun of Wano but probably will soon either die or be replaced by Momonosuke.\n\nThe **Mink Tribe**, strongly linked to Kozukis are heavily related to the Moon as the simple sight of the Full Moon makes them entering in Sulong form. This particularity and the fact we see [Mink-like character during Enel\u2019s great space mission](https://imgur.com/a/YhFFZSn) lets us think they can be from the Moon. They can use electricity.\n\nThe **Lunarian Tribe** is probably from the Moon too. This would be weird not being the case due to their names and their wings. While Minks can use electricity, Lunarian are able to use fire to be almost invincible. They are able to live in extreme circumstances.\n\nNote that I\u2019m talking about the \u201cMoon\u201d but [they could be from different Moons too](https://imgur.com/a/nuX0BWt).\n\n[End in the comment!](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/rn6goj/comment/hpqfufo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)",

    "text": "ArcheAge KR 3.0 - Trade Pack changes The Trade Pack ingredients in KR 3.0 have been reworked a little. Most packs require more ingredients and some are even nerfed hard, a few exceptions now take less ingredients. The quality certificate has been removed and crafting a pack just takes straight up silver. Half of the regular packs now take a Gilda as an ingredient. I haven't seen confirmation yet that these packs grant additional rewards.\n\nThe payout of KR 3.0 packs goes up to 140%, where NA/EU 2.9 packs cap at 130%. Normal packs are down to 50 Labor, whereas the Fertilizer and Fellowship packs cost 60 Labor to craft.\n\nHaranyan Specialties\t|\tNA/EU 2.9\t|\t70 Labor, Cert\t|\t#\t|\tKR 3.0\t|\t50 Labor,
